# Contributing

Have an awesome RiveScript project to add to this list? Send a
[pull request](https://github.com/aichaos/awesome-rivescript/pulls) to
get your link included!

Ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
* Use the following format: `[package](link) - Description`
* Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
* New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
* Link to the GitHub repo if the project has one.
* Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
* Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is configured to remove trailing whitespaces.
* The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the
  project and why it should be included.

## Updating your Pull Request

If your pull request doesn't meet the above criteria, you'll be suggested to
fix it. You can update your existing pull request with new changes; don't just
close it and make a new one.

You can find information on updating a pull request
[at this link](https://github.com/RichardLitt/docs/blob/master/amending-a-commit-guide.md).
